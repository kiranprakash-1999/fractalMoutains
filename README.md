# What are Fractal Mountains?

Fractal mountains are computer-generated, realistic mountains generated from a fractal algorithm folding a triangle.
We start off by drawing a triangle in 3D space. We must create a coordinate system that can make a 2D plane act as a 3D place. Within our original triangle, we connect the midpoints of each line to form 4 triangles, and then shift each vertex up, down, or diagonally by a randomly generated number. This is repeated to obtain a fractal mountain
Other features were added such as shading algorithms, colouring methods, and the ability to rotate the mountain to any orientation.
This project was a group effort, which involved contribution from my computer science teacher, Mr. Nick Nolfi (misternolfi.com).
